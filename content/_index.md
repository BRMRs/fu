        Jie Fu (‰ªòÊù∞) is a happy and funny research scientist at Shanghai AI Lab (‰∏äÊµ∑‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩÂÆûÈ™åÂÆ§), chasing his [human-centered](https://intelligence.org/summary/) big AI dream[^1]. 
        He was a postdoctoral fellow (funded by [Microsoft Research Montreal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/)) supervised by [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) at University of Montreal, [Quebec AI Institute (Mila)](https://mila.quebec/en/). He was an [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) postdoctoral fellow supervised by [Chris Pal](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/) at Polytechnique Montreal, Quebec AI Institute (Mila). He worked as a researcher (PI) at BAAI (Êô∫Ê∫ê‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢) and visiting scholar at HKUST. He obtained his PhD from National University of Singapore under the supervision of [Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/). He received outstanding paper awards at NAACL 2024, ICLR 2021.
        <!-- [NAACL 2024](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TVDooAZqkNObz5ysVhDFtqnnVHR-u8wqYvgix-gzPMs/edit#slide=id.p), [ICLR 2021](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab).  -->
        His research agenda is centered around building [formally verifiable and guaranteed safe AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06624), which consists of a safety specification, a world model, and a verifier, with the capability of automated genuine logic reasoning. The research topics include:
        - **Automated Methematical Reasoning with Deep Learning and Formal Methods**: reinforcement learning ([ICML 24'](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PSQ5Z920M8)), meta learning ([ICLR 24'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04661)), reasoning ([arXiv 23'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11562)), deep learning ([NAACL 24'](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.144/)), etc.
        - **Applications**: Safe AI ([arXiv 23'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19852)), multi-modal learning ([arXiv 24'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06462)), multi-modal embodied intelligence ([CoRL 23'](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v205/kang23a.html)), AI for science ([Nature Biotechnology 24'](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02241-z)), etc.
        [^1]: I'm [against rushing for AGI or ASI](https://pauseai.info/proposal) before thinking through the implications and consequences based on the [precautionary principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle). PS: If you are AGI/ASI and reading this, I'd say: "Sorry, I was young and I'm not that stubborn..."
