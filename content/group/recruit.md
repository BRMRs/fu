I am always interested to recruit self-motivated students to join my group as (online or offline) interns. 
I have opennings for full-time {Researchers, Research Assistants} as of 2024-12, and will have PhD positions in 2025. 
A more detailed description can be found at this [Zhihu post](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/477800872). 
<!-- I also have opennings for full-time {PhD students, Postdocs, Research Assistants} as of 2023-Oct. 

{{% callout note %}}
PhD or Mphil offers will be considered in favor of interns or RAs who worked with me, which makes both sides to be less likely to regret.

<!-- I'm a hands-on senior postdoc: I'd like to give very concrete suggestions and have frequent (can be short) 1-1 meetings with junior student.  -->

<!-- Here is a list of my current key research interests:

- **Deep Learning**: meta learning, transformer, sample-efficient learning
- **Drug Discovery**: geometric deep learning, molecular dynamics
- **Reinforcement Learning**: offline RL, model-based RL
- **Language Processing**: code generation -->

Drop me an email if you want to have a chat.
